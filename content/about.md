Hi, I’m Guido! I’m a software engineer with over 10 years of experience and a knack for solving tricky problems. 
These days, I’m at BeFrank, where I try to make pensions... well, maybe not exciting, but definitely safe and sound! 

I got into software engineering because I love puzzles—especially the ones that involve reliability, scalability, and untangling complex business domains. 
I’m all about domain-driven design, software architecture, and geeking out over anything that makes building software better, from agile methodologies to CI/CD 
to product management (and everything in between).

I also like gardening my home server, running self-hosted apps like [Readeck](https://readeck.org/en/) and [Immich](https://immich.app/), so I might just write a thing or 
two about that too.
